# LVR-Auction-Hook
LVR Auction Hook is a Uniswap V4 hook that integrates with an EigenLayer AVS to auction the right to be first-in-block for trades, redistributing MEV extraction proceeds directly to liquidity providers instead of validators. This system compensates LPs for LVR losses by turning arbitrage opportunities into revenue streams.
